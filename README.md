## Overview
For this test project I have written Selenium tests for UI portion of test app, including bugs which are in BugsTests class.
For the backedn part, one endpoint is covered with positive/negative tests.

## Prerequisites
Maven is used as a builder, Java 8 and TestNG as a testing framework.
Chromedriver is included here, please download latest if it's outdated

### Note
test-output and Output packages are left intentionaly, so it shows screenshots of failed tests and emailable-report.html with them.
